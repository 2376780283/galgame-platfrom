        All links are added by users, the KUN Visual Novel Forum does not
        provide any download functionality
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>You can earn 3 moemoepoints for each resource link you publish</p>
    <p>
      If a resource link is deleted, the moemoepoints obtained through that link
      will also be deducted
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        All resource links must be related to the game on this page, must be
        free, and cannot require points or paid downloads
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      All links must be in hyperlink format, and cannot be mixed with other
      non-hyperlink formatted text, such as cloud storage types
    </p>
    <p>
      Resource links can be magnet links, cloud storage links, URLs, etc. You
      can contribute resource links repeatedly, but each person can only
      contribute once for the same type of link (same cloud storage, URL, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
      You are allowed to link to other websites, but the target website must
      allow open downloads (forbidden login to download)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Do not add links to cloud storage download sites. See
