    <h3>The Significance of KUNGalgame Creation:</h3>

    <ul class="list">
      <li>
        Actively promote truly good games, ensuring that everyone uses websites
        like VNDB to see real
        <span class="skip">visualized data</span> and avoid being misled by
        "experts."
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Avoid the negative aspects of modern internet trends, such as the
          culture of praising and criticizing, valuing criticism as a virtue,
          etc.</strong
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        Encourage everyone to learn basic computer fundamentals to prevent the
        emergence of "keyboard warriors."
      </li>
      <li>
        Build a forum focused on individual user enjoyment, resisting the
        creation of elitist hierarchies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Many current websites use templates, resulting in a monotonous
        aesthetic; we aim to address this issue.
      </li>
      <li>...and more.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      We believe: "<strong style="color: red"
        >A game that brings you joy and makes you genuinely laugh is a truly
        good game!</strong
      >"
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      Our ultimate goal is to create:
      <strong>The world's best Galgame forum!</strong>
    </p>

    <h2 id="principle">Operating Principles</h2>
    <br />
    <h3>1. The Cutest Visual Novel Forum in the World</h3>
    <p>
      Here, "cutest" doesn't just mean literally "cute / moe"; it refers to all
      the beautiful things in the world. Anything that makes you happy and feel
      wonderful can be called "cute / moe." This means that we have no set
      rules; all rules depend on everyone's common opinions.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      A visual novel forum means that
      <strong>
        we focus primarily on visual novels, and all topics on the homepage are
        related to visual novels. Other topics are placed in
        <span class="skip">
          <NuxtLinkLocale to="/pool">Topic Pool</NuxtLinkLocale>
        </span>
      </strong>
    </p>
    <h3>2. To Create The Best Atmosphere</h3>
    <p>
      Continuing from the previous point, before I started designing the entire
      website, I wrote the following on the design drawing:
    </p>
    <br />
    <ul class="list">
      <li>
        Promoting truly good games, so everyone can see real
        <span class="skip">visualized data</span> on websites like VNDB and
        avoid being misled by "experts."
      </li>
      <li>
        Rejecting the modern internet trend of praising and bashing, considering
        criticism a virtue.
      </li>
      <li>
        Empowering anyone to learn basic computer skills to avoid "newbie"
        issues.
      </li>
      <li>
        Building a forum focused on individual user enjoyment, resisting the
        creation of hierarchies.
      </li>
      <li>...</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>
      This means that unkind behavior, such as sarcasm and bashing, is not
      allowed on KUN Visual Novel. Of course, this all depends on everyone's
      opinions.
    </p>
    <h3>3. NO ADs Forever</h3>
    <p>
      Literally,
      <strong>the website will never have any form of advertisements</strong>.
      We believe a good forum should not have any advertising. If you find
      something resembling an ad, please report it. If 10 people report it, the
      topic will be locked.
    </p>
    <h3>4. Free Forever</h3>
    <p>
      Literally,
      <strong
        >no one will ever spend money on the website's virtual currency
        (Moemoepoints)</strong
      >. The amount of virtual currency depends on appreciation from others. If
      you would like to support us, you can do so
      <span class="skip">
        <NuxtLinkLocale to="/donate">here</NuxtLinkLocale>
      </span>
      .
    </p>
    <h2 id="stipulate">Forum Guidelines</h2>
    <p>
      Guidelines? No, we have
      <strong>no guidelines</strong>. All guidelines depend on everyone's common
      opinions.
    </p>
    <p>However, we hope to keep things kind and minimize hostility.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 10px">
      To avoid having your account deleted prematurely,
      <strong style="color: red">we offer these suggestions</strong>
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>1. No political discussions.</li>
      <li>2. No advertising or solicitation.</li>
      <li>
        3. For sensitive topics, please include a clear warning in the article
        title, e.g., R18, R18-G, etc.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>
      Why offer suggestions? Because these are not "Moe" behaviors. If you'd
      like to learn more about posting etiquette, please see
