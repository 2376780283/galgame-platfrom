**We sincerely thank everyone who has contributed to the development of KUN Visual Novel! And thank you to those who use the KUN Visual Novel Forum!**

  

### Significance

*   Actively promote truly good games, ensuring that everyone uses websites like VNDB to see real visualized data and avoid being misled by "experts."
*   **Avoid the negative aspects of modern internet trends, such as the culture of praising and criticizing, valuing criticism as a virtue, etc.**
*   Encourage everyone to learn basic computer fundamentals to prevent the emergence of "keyboard warriors."
*   Build a forum focused on individual user enjoyment, resisting the creation of elitist hierarchies.
*   Many current websites use templates, resulting in a monotonous aesthetic; we aim to address this issue.
*   ...and more.

  


We believe: "**A game that brings you joy and makes you genuinely laugh is a truly good game!**"

  


Our ultimate goal is to create: **The world's best Galgame forum!**

Operating Principles
--------------------

  

### 1\. The Cutest Visual Novel Forum in the World

Here, "cutest" doesn't just mean literally "cute / moe"; it refers to all the beautiful things in the world. Anything that makes you happy and feel wonderful can be called "cute / moe." This means that we have no set rules; all rules depend on everyone's common opinions.

  

A visual novel forum means that **we focus primarily on visual novels, and all topics on the homepage are related to visual novels. Other topics are placed in Topic Pool**

### 2\. To Create The Best Atmosphere

Continuing from the previous point, before I started designing the entire website, I wrote the following on the design drawing:

  

*   Promoting truly good games, so everyone can see real visualized data on websites like VNDB and avoid being misled by "experts."
*   Rejecting the modern internet trend of praising and bashing, considering criticism a virtue.
*   Empowering anyone to learn basic computer skills to avoid "newbie" issues.
*   Building a forum focused on individual user enjoyment, resisting the creation of hierarchies.
*   ...

  

This means that unkind behavior, such as sarcasm and bashing, is not allowed on KUN Visual Novel. Of course, this all depends on everyone's opinions.

### 3\. NO ADs Forever

Literally, **the website will never have any form of advertisements**. We believe a good forum should not have any advertising. If you find something resembling an ad, please report it. If 10 people report it, the topic will be locked.

### 4\. Free Forever

Literally, **no one will ever spend money on the website's virtual currency (Moemoepoints)**. The amount of virtual currency depends on appreciation from others. If you would like to support us, you can do so here .

Forum Guidelines
----------------

Guidelines? No, we have **no guidelines**. All guidelines depend on everyone's common opinions.

However, we hope to keep things kind and minimize hostility.

To avoid having your account deleted prematurely, **we offer these suggestions**

*   1\. No political discussions.
*   2\. No advertising or solicitation.
*   3\. For sensitive topics, please include a clear warning in the article title, e.g., R18, R18-G, etc.

  

Why offer suggestions? Because these are not "Moe" behaviors. If you'd like to learn more about posting etiquette, please see the [Non-Moe Records](https://kungal.com/non-moe) .
